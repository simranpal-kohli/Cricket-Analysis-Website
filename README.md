# Cricket-Analysis-Website
## Technology: MVC .NET Application

## Project Description & Motivation:
I started this project during my undergrad. At that time, I was very enthusiast Cricket fan. I was very curious in knowing the best performing players in individual departments
i.e. Batting, Bowling, Fielding, All-Rounder, Wicket-Keeper. I was also curious in knowing the best performing team in a league. Therefore, I started building this application & 
thought to take this further by integrating with Machine Learning Techniques to analyse more on the performance. 
I Would really appreciate if I get any collaboration on this project.

## Data: I added .mdf file which contains demo Cricket data with complex query objects.
## Please feel free to reach out to me by contacting from my website.
